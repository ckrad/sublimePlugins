[simple-db-migrate](http://guilhermechapiewski.github.io/simple-db-migrate/)
is a database versioning and migration tool inspired on Rails
Migrations created by
[Guilherme Chapiewski](https://github.com/guilhermechapiewski).
It helps you manage and track your database schema changes.

That package will highlight properly the SQL inside the `.migration` files in
Sublime Text.

To install through Package Control, search for __SQL (simple-db-migrate)__. If
you still don't have Package Control in Sublime Text, go get it. If you insist
to not install it, you can download the package and put it manually inside your
Pacakages directory. It should work but will not update automatically.
